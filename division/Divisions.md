# Divisions

Here are a list of Divisions and a brief description of what they do in this club:

## [Software](Software)

So the Software Division does things with code and stuff.
We get confused when code doesn't work, and we get confused when code does work.
It worked on our machines; why didn't it work on yours? End User Error. 'Nuf said.

## [Hardware](Hardware)

The Hardware Division has to do with the more physical side of things.
They are supposed to build things that can do interesting things I guess.
Don't break anything important. Please. Makerbot Replicators cost upwards of $4000

## [Systems](Systems)

The Systems Division is supposed to integrate the Software and the Hardware to make things actually work.
Expect frustration, as usually the two don't want to work together. We deal with Cable Spaghetti **AND** Spaghetti Code, and it's not as delicious as it sounds.
