subtitle: We Code Unlogical Things!

## Section Overview

The Software Division is in charge of all the coding and programing that allows for interaction between people and the machine iteself. Unlike Systems, we don't have to worry about making the Hardware work with the Software, but instead making sure the Software works. If you have no prior knowledge, don't worry. We'll get you caught up. We will be using C# to code, however, if by popular demand, we will shift towards Java instead. Be ready for hours of frustration and anger, as it will be difficult to code things that work logically. 

## Section Specific Rules:

Please refrain from doing anything stupid on the computers. Please. We like this club.

If you need help, just ask. I'm sure someone will help you. Eventually.

Attend meetings.Please. The Software Division is responsible for making things work. Doesn't matter if a robot is built, only to find out that there is no programming to make it do anything other than just stand there.

Only be nice to the other sections if you want to. We don't need them for anything other than the physical aspects of the club.

I don't know what to put here but we need 5 rules so here.

### Section Stuff

The Software Division includes...

Coding things for other divisions

Coding things that annoy the other divisions

Coding things that don't ever work because logic

Coding things that don't make any sense, but still work

## Extra Information:

USE COMMON SENSE. PLEASE.

Logic won't work most of the time. Be prepared for hours of frustration as code that should work finds a way to break.

Mathematics is pretty important. Knowing things like vectors and how a 3d system works is kinda important.

If you have no prior knowledge, don't worry about it. We'll teach you how things work. I think.
