subtitle: We Combine Software and Hardware!

# Section Overview:

Typically everyone will need a computer, a brain and the ability and motivation to build things they want to build. Systems addresses both software and hardware. Anyone in systems will most likely be learning with CNC machines, which are used to 3D print things. So anyone interested in building and programming, this is the place for you. Our ultimate goal this year will most likely be building a cnc machine, whether it be a 3D printer or a milling machine or even a writing machine, and programming it to do those specific tasks, such as read input files and create the models presented in computers, in real life. We may also be building robot drives and modular attachments build for specific tasks.

# Section Specific Rules:

Building a CNC machine is not an easy task, especially at the scale that I plan to take it to so some ground rules will be needed.

Those who join are expected to abide by the rules presented in the constitution

They must not fool around.

## Materials Needed:
Computer

Paper/Pencil
