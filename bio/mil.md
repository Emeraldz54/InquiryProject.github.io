Hi!

I'm Michael Lee, and I make coding for the computer thingys that sometimes work and other times just make things crash and burn.
I'm also in charge of the Software section, and this website which I totally won't do anything with...

But anyways, I do most of the software things that happen around here. Don't believe what Charles says about the webpage. He may be coding some of the more advanced stuff, but who does he come to when he needs help fixing the webpage or adding some new complex suggestions.

I've done quite a bit of coding, from coding for Google Code to creating a homebrew text-based rpg with a a certain Justin Goodberry.
I know many different programing languages, including but not limited to html, C#, C++, Java, and Python.

If you have any questions, would like to post anything important, or just want to completely ruin Charles's page, let me know.

And don't worry, even people like me wonder why logic goes out the window when it comes to coding.

I'm @Emeraldz54 on this website. More contact info under the Contact Tab in the Top Right.

Oh and send me random pictures and other foolish stuff to put in random spots on this website.
