Hello!

My name is Daniel Hwang, and I'm a senior.
Like the name says, I'll be in charge of communications and delivering necessary information to the masses.

More on me personally, I'm interested in various things, but two of my main passions are Mathematics and Computer Science.
I also enjoy collaborating on tech projects, hence why I joined this club.
I'm mainly going to be focused on the software side, but I'll dabble into systems & hardware.

I'm also invested in other clubs such as Speech & Debate, but I'm focused on making this club a success.


I look forward to working with you this year and hope to see you at meetings.
