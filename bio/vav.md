Hi guys, I’m Vatsal, the VP of Systems. 

VP Systems is currently the position that manages the integration of hardware and software. In layman’s terms, I’m the guy that connects your machine to the computer and gets it to work.

I will probably be coding and helping out with modeling the machines that I and others want to build. I will most likely be helping out with the algorithmic thinking process of how to make a machine do what you want it to do.

Other than that, I’m @Tornado145 on GitHub, and kiwi drive is the future of humanity.
