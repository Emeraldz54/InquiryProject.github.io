Hello!

  I'm Charles. I'm the President of the club. Now, as per the Constitution, I'm just here to organize everything, not really do stuff. And that's what I plan to do: let you guys do whatever you want, as long as it follows the Club's message, school rules, and local/state/federal/international laws. I've given the VPs free reign over what they choose to do, and delegated responsibilities to each of the officers accordingly, and will allow you guys to pursue whatever projects you want to once they are approved. Yet, somehow, I've done most of the work. I've (technically) even done more work on the website than the *webmaster* has... So, looks like I'm going to have to do **a lot** of work to keep this club running smoothly...\*sigh\*

  If you don't know me, I love Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, which conveniently checks off every part of STEM. As such, you'll probably see me around every division of the club, helping to troubleshoot and making Michael's life harder by telling him to make impossible things on the website (I'm just like Tesla!). I'm also helping McAvoy and Fincher with Calculus Knight Time, and am also working on getting Science Club back up and running, but now with more science!

  I'll probably help teach some of the more annoying maths concepts you guys are going to need to learn to do stuff, particularly in Systems and Software. You'll be learning graphs, vectors, matrices and information theory from me (or, if you want, quantum mechanics and quantum information theory :D). Seriously though, those two fields need a surprisingly large amount of maths just to get a car to turn instead of strafe. Yes, you read that correctly, and yes, I speak from experience. Stupid kiwi drive.

  I also love building stuff. I've made a suit jacket out of duct-tape, a mechanical clock out of Legos and a kilogram mass, and a flute out of a ballpoint pen. I 3D printed a rocket for Drafting with Tristan--the parachute didn't deploy but the rocket survived its collision with the school parking lot. I helped build numerous column structures in elementary school that weighed less than 20g and held a few hundred pounds (the Chinese held a literal *ton* though...). I basically designed the Vex robot for the team a few year ago, and I'm helping out with the current robot.

  In my free time, I learn really complicated mathematics, physics, and chemistry-s. I wrote a paper on von Neumann entropy while I was taking a course at Harvard, and one of the professors there, Prof. Arthur Jaffe, read it for me and said there wasn't anything wrong with it :D (to be fair though, it was focusing on one single topic in quantum information, and would have seemed to him like I was explaining 1+1 to you...) [Here's the paper](../files/entropy-quantum-information.pdf "Seriously? You're going to click? Tell you what. If you can tell me what entropy means in information, I'll give you a disappointing prize.") if any of you are interested in reading it, though I have no idea why you would. It contains many painful things, like density operators, outer products of vectors in Hilbert Space, and logarithms of matrices. *I*  wrote it and I barely understand most of the stuff going on in that paper. But I digress.

  If you're ever unsure about anything, feel free to ask me a question. I promise I won't be super sarcastic like McAvoy. Unless you're asking me an incredibly stupid question like: "multiply six by nine" in which case I will give the obvious answer of 42 and tell you to stop wasting my time. But seriously, I will try to be as helpful as I can. My contact info can be found on the [Contact](../contact) page, at the very bottom, under all of the important stuff.
  
  p.s. because daniel is the officer in charge of communication, i will take every opportunity to call him out on his lapses in rhetoric, partly because he took AP Language and Compostition last year, partly because he's in Speech and Debate, mostly because HE'S IN CHARGE OF COMMUNICATING
