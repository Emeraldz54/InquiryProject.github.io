If you don't know who Mr. Rosse is, you really missed out. Mr. Rosse helped with esports, chess/go, quiz bowl, board games, science olympiad, and of course, this club.

Since freshman year, I've practically lived in Mr. Rosse's room. I was always in his room after school, working on some project or practicing for some competition.
